# LearningJavascript

Laearning javascript basic to advance with source code

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. 
After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. 
Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.

Note
* Internet Explorer 9 did not support ES5 "use strict".

** Internet Explorer 11 does not support ES6.

From ES4 to ES6
When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps:

The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp:
Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

The ECMAScript 4 Camp:
Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.

August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email:

It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.

The solution was to work together:

ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5
ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.
Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.
TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.
